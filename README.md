# dominican-liturgy
Public resources for Dominican liturgical needs.

This repository is to provide simple resources that could be of interest to the Dominican Family.  This repository should focus on content that is public (that is, not restricted by copyright).  I am under the impression that the Dominican propers in English are free to be used by the Dominican Family to help support broader liturgical usage, however psalms in either the Grail or Abbey Psalms and Canticles translations (and readings from the office of readings of the LOTH) are not to be included in the public resources unless and until explicit permissions were to be obtained.

Collaboration is welcome and encouraged!  Open an issue or create a PR/MR to extend this.

# Contents
## insert
In the insert folder are a number of things intended to be printed as "inserts" for existing editions of the Liturgy of the Hours.  
* `salve_olumen` is a one page (front and back) insert that is meant to fit inside of either your breviary or the green boon of Dominican compline in English which contains the Dominican Salve Regina and O Lumen with their corresponding prayers in Latin and English.
* `vol2` is another one-page insert with propers for volume 2 of the Liturgy of the Hours (Lent and Easter).  It contains the Dominican confeteor, the proper antiphons and responsories (which are not included in the LOTH) and the Dominican final blessing. 
* Similar inserts are intended for Advent/Christmas (`vol1`) and Ordinary time (`vol3/4`) but haven't been written yet.

## Other
* I have transcribed the English translation of the traditional Office of the Dead for the Dominicans.  Only references are included to the psalms and the biblical readings; one can look those up in any convenient translation.
* While it is not specifically Dominican, I have transcribed the new translation of the Te Deum that was published in the USCCB committe on divine worship newsletter.
